This is a lightweight package to send flash messages in Laravel apps.  A flash message is a message that is carried over to the next request by storing it in the session. This package only supports one single flash message at a time.

This is how it can be used:

```php
class MySpecialSnowflakeController
{
    public function store()
    {
        // …

        flash('My message', 'my-class');

        return back();
    }
}
```

In your view you can do this:

```blade
@include('flash::message')
```

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-flash
```

## Usage

Here is an example on how to flash a message.

```php
class MyController
{
    public function store()
    {
        // …

        flash('My message');

        return back();
    }
}
```

In your view you can use it like this

```blade
@include('flash::message')
```

> You can pass an array of messages to be rendered once as [laravel validations errors](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#quick-displaying-the-validation-errors)

Here is an example:

```php
flash(['first message', 'second message', 'third message']);
```

Output HTML

```html
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>first message</li>
        <li>second message</li>
        <li>third message</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

### Using a class name to style the displayed message

You can add a class as the second parameter. This is typically used to style the output in your HTML.

```php
class MyController
{
    public function store()
    {
        // …

        flash('My message', 'my-class'));

        return back();
    }
}
```

In your view you can use the class like this:

```blade
@include('flash::message')
```

You can also set an array of classes. These will be output by `flash()->class` by imploding the array with a space-delimiter.

```php
 flash('My message', ['my-class', 'another-class'])); // flash()->class output is: 'my-class another-class'
```


### Adding your own methods

If you don't want to specify a class each time you flash a message you can add a method name to `flash`.

The easiest way is by passing an array to the `levels` method. The key is the method name that should be added to `flash()`. The value is the class that will automatically be used when rendering the message.

```php
// this would probably go in a service provider

\Spatie\Flash\Flash::levels([
    'success' => 'alert-success',
    'warning' => 'alert-warning',
    'error' => 'alert-error',
]);
```

The above example will make these methods available on `flash`:

```php
flash()->success('Hurray');
flash()->warning('Mayybeee');
flash()->error('Oh Oh');
```

Additionally, when you've added your own method, you can also pass that method name as a second parameter to `flash` itself:

```php
flash('Hurray', 'success'); // `flash()->class` will output 'alert-success'
```

You can also add a method to `flash` by using `macro`.

Here's an example:

```php
// this would probably go in a service provider

use Spatie\Flash\Message;

\Spatie\Flash\Flash::macro('warning', function(string $message) {
    return $this->flashMessage(new Message($message, 'alert alert-warning'));
});
```

You can now use a `warning` method on `flash`:

```php
flash()->warning('Look above you!');
```

## Custom view

You can custom the view:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Flash\FlashServiceProvider"
```
